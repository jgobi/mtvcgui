== Troubles opening /dev/dsp - Cannot open demuxer. - Capturing audio using ALSA ==

Maybe mencoder is trying to capture the audio using oss, and your mencoder or kernel has no support for it. What you can do is to specify to use alsa.

You can do that by adding *alsa* as an extra tv parameter.

Also you may specify the device if you have multiple inputs, or you are not getting sound.

for example: *alsa:hw.0*

That will record from the first device.

To get a list of devices you may run: 
{{{aplay -l}}}
