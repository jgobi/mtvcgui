== Troubles opening /dev/dsp - Cannot open demuxer. - Capturing audio using ALSA ==

Maybe mencoder is trying to capture the audio using oss, and your mencoder or kernel has no support for it. What you can do is to specify to use alsa.

You can do that specifying capturing using *ALSA* in the extra TV parameters tab.

You also need to specify the device. Generally *hw.0*

That will record from the first device.

To get a list of devices you may run: 
{{{arecord -l}}}



== I get a black and white image ==

Black and white image can be probably misconfiguration of the norm.

The program defaults to NTSC (normid=0).

You must adjust this value to the norm used in your country.

A tooltip with normid values will show up if you point over the normid scroll box.
